# theory-of-computation-DFA
This project required the implementation of two separate finite automaton.

### Problem 1 </br>
The program takes in an integer, n, and outputs the number of strings of size n that satisfy the following property: In any substring of length 6, all four letters a, b, c and d occur at least once.

### Problem 2 </br>
The program takes in an integer, k, and a set of digits d, and outputs the smallest integer N > 0 such that N % k = 0 and N uses only digits from d.
